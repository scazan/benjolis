## Norns

### UI:
use K2 and K3 to
cycle through pairs of dials.

use E2 and E3 to
adjust the left and right
dials of the selected
pair.

use E1 to
control volume.

if you hold K1 (shift)
and use K2, you will
have a momentary mute.

if you hold K1 (shift)
and use K3, you will
have a mute that toggles.

### CONTROLS:
at the bottom of the params
menu there are four MIDI
mappings that you can enable.

first choose the external device.

then there are three options for
each mapping:
- enable mapping
- MIDI channel
- note mapping

enable mapping is, itself,
MIDI mappable and simply
enables this mapping or not.

MIDI channel sets the incoming
MIDI channel for this mapping
to listen to

note mapping sets which param
this will be mapped to.
