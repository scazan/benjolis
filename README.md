## Norns

### UI:
Use buttons 2 and 3 to
cycle through pairs of dials.

Use encoders 2 and 3 to
adjust the left and right
dials of the selected
pair.

Use encoder 1 to 
control volume.

If you hold button 1 (shift)
and use button 2, you will
have a momentary mute.
 
If you hold button 1 (shift)
and use button 3, you will
have a mute that toggles.
