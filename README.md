## Norns

### UI:
Use K2 and K3 to
cycle through pairs of dials.

Use E2 and E3 to
adjust the left and right
dials of the selected
pair.

Use E1 to
control volume.

If you hold K1 (shift)
and use K2, you will
have a momentary mute.
 
If you hold K1 (shift)
and use K3, you will
have a mute that toggles.
